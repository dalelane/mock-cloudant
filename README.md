This is a node.js module to mock IBM Cloudant for testing based on mock-couch. See https://github.com/chris-l/mock-couch and http://chris-l.github.io/mock-couch/

In addition to mock-couch, this library provides a basic version of Cloudant's _find endpoint as well as the ability to POST single documents (in addition to POST _bulk_docs).

Installation:
```
npm install --save-dev fubar/mock-cloudant
```
